# Methodology

## Problem Definition

The classifier maps raw RF signal recordings to six labels:
`dooralarm`, `lora`, `microphone`, `mbus`, `sigfox`, and `miwi`. The label
ordering is fixed in `src/config.py` and is preserved in model metadata and
probability output.

## Input Data

The code expects one NumPy array per class. The local dataset reviewed for this
documentation contains `10,000,000` `float32` samples in each raw and external
test file.

| Purpose | File pattern | Treatment |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Training source | `data/raw/<class>.npy` | Non-overlapping windows used to construct train/validation/held-out test subsets |
| External test source | `data/test/<class>_test.npy` | Whole-file prediction using overlapping inference windows |

With `WINDOW_SIZE = 4096`, each local raw file supplies `2441` complete
training windows; remaining trailing samples are discarded. The balanced
six-class training-source dataset therefore contains `14,646` windows before
splitting.

## Signal Preprocessing

The active transformation is implemented in `src/preprocessing.py` and shared
by training and inference.

| Step | Configuration/behavior |
| --- | --- |
| Window length | `4096` samples |
| Training/evaluation segmentation | Non-overlapping windows |
| Whole-file inference segmentation | Overlapping windows, default step `1024` |
| Window normalization | Subtract the window mean and divide by its standard deviation plus `1e-8` |
| Spectrogram window | Hann |
| `nperseg` / `noverlap` / `nfft` | `256` / `192` / `512` |
| Spectrogram scaling | `spectrum` |
| Compression | `log1p(spectrum)` |
| Spectrogram normalization | Per-spectrogram zero mean and unit standard deviation |
| CNN input shape | `257 x 61 x 1` |

For inference on a file, the CNN output probabilities are averaged over all
overlapping windows. This provides one consolidated prediction and confidence
per signal file.

## Model and Training

The CNN consists of four convolutional feature-extraction blocks followed by a
fully connected classification head. Detailed layer shapes appear in
[architecture.md](architecture.md).

Default training configuration:

| Setting | Value |
| --- | --- |
| Classes | `6` |
| Batch size | `32` |
| Maximum epochs | `15` |
| Seed | `42` |
| Learning rate | `3e-4` |
| Optimizer | Adam |
| Loss | Categorical cross-entropy |
| Split | Stratified 80% train / 10% validation / 10% held-out test windows |
| Balancing | Enabled by default; truncate each class to the minimum class window count |

Training callbacks:

| Callback | Setting |
| --- | --- |
| `ReduceLROnPlateau` | Monitor validation loss, factor `0.5`, patience `3`, minimum LR `1e-6` |
| `EarlyStopping` | Monitor validation accuracy, patience `6`, restore best weights |
| `ModelCheckpoint` | Save the best validation-accuracy model to `models/best_iot_classifier.h5` |

## Evaluation Modes

The repository exposes three distinct evaluations; their metrics are not
interchangeable.

| Command/path | Unit measured | Appropriate interpretation |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Training held-out report in `models/` | Individual non-overlapping windows held out after random split of `data/raw` windows | Internal test estimate; windows still originate from the same six source recordings as training |
| `python src/evaluate.py --data-dir data/raw --evaluation-role training-source-diagnostic` | Individual windows loaded from `data/raw` | Diagnostic scoring on the training-source recordings, not independent test performance |
| `python src/test.py --data-dir data/test` output in `results/test/` | One consolidated prediction per external file | External file-level check; currently only six scored files |

## Recorded Results

The following figures are read from checked-in artifacts; reporting metadata
was augmented during the review remediation:

| Evaluation | Samples/files | Accuracy | Source artifact |
| --- | ---: | ---: | --- |
| Training held-out window split | `1465` windows | `0.9454` | `models/metadata.json` |
| Raw-directory window evaluation | `14,646` windows | `0.9900` | `results/evaluation/metrics.json` |
| External file-level ensemble test | `6` files | `1.0000` | `results/test/metrics.json` |

The external result means all six available class files were predicted
correctly. The file-level 95% Wilson interval is approximately `[0.610,
1.000]`, reflecting that one scored recording per class does not establish a
statistically robust 100% generalization rate.

## Reproducible Commands

```bash
# Train and generate model-held-out reports.
python src/train.py --data-dir data/raw --output-dir models

# Diagnose predictions over all labeled raw-source windows.
python src/evaluate.py \
  --data-dir data/raw \
  --evaluation-role training-source-diagnostic \
  --output-dir results/evaluation

# Evaluate the separate test files at file level.
python src/test.py --data-dir data/test --output-dir results/test

# Run one-file inference.
python src/predict.py --input data/test/miwi_test.npy
```

## Methodological Limitations

- Randomly splitting windows from each continuous source recording can
  overestimate performance on new recordings or devices; recording-level
  splits are preferable when additional captures are available.
- The raw-directory evaluation reuses training-source files and must not be
  cited as an independent validation metric.
- The external test report contains six file-level observations, so it is an
  operational smoke test rather than sufficient performance evidence.
- Compatibility modules now delegate to the active pipeline; notebook-only
  code remains historical context rather than an executable baseline.
